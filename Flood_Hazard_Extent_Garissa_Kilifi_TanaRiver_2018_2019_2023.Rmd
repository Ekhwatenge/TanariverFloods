## Introduction
This report analyzes the flood hazard extent data for **Garissa**, **Kilifi**, and **Tana River** counties for the years 2018, 2019, and 2023. The data is in vector format and was merged from various sources, including UNOSAT.
```
```{r load-data}
# Load the shapefile
flood_data <- st_read("/Users/elvir/OneDrive/Desktop/RProjects/TanariverFloods/floodextent01/FloodExtent01.shp")

# View the first few rows of the data
head(flood_data)
```
```{r summary}
# Summary of the dataset
summary(flood_data)

# Number of features
nrow(flood_data)

# Bounding box of the dataset
st_bbox(flood_data)
```
```markdown
The map below visualizes the flood extent across Garissa, Kilifi, and Tana River counties over the period 2018, 2019, and 2023.
```

```{r plot-flood}
# Simple plot of the flood extent
plot(flood_data["geometry"], main = "Flood Extent in Garissa, Kilifi, and Tana River (2018-2023)")
```
 
```{r total-area}
# Make geometries valid
flood_data <- st_make_valid(flood_data)

# Calculate the total flood area (in square meters) for each county
flood_data$area <- st_area(flood_data)

# Check column names in the dataset
colnames(flood_data)
# Summarize the total flood area by the county-equivalent column (e.g., 'region')
# Add a county column manually (this is just an example)
# You would need to assign the correct counties based on the polygons
flood_data$county <- c("Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi", "Tana River","Garissa", "Kilifi")  # Example values

# Now summarize the total area by this new 'county' column
total_area_by_county <- flood_data %>%
  group_by(county) %>%
  summarise(total_area = sum(area))

# View the result
total_area_by_county
# Summarize the area by county (assuming there is a county column in the data)
total_area_by_county <- flood_data %>%
  group_by(county) %>%
  summarise(total_area = sum(area))

# View the results
total_area_by_county
```

```{r the_columns}

colnames(flood_data)
```
```{r summary_floodArea_county}
    # Summarize the total flood area (in hectares) by county
total_flood_by_county <- flood_data %>%
  group_by(county) %>%
  summarise(total_area_ha = sum(Area_ha, na.rm = TRUE))

# View the results
total_flood_by_county
```
## Conclusion

This report analyzed flood hazard extent data for **Garissa**, **Kilifi**, and **Tana River** counties over the years 2018, 2019, and 2023. The analysis provided insights into the total flood areas for each county, the changes in flood extent over time, and highlighted which county was most affected by flooding in 2023.

Further analysis could focus on the specific causes of the flooding, its impact on local communities, and possible mitigation strategies.
